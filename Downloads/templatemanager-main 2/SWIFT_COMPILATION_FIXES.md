# Swift Compilation and Runtime Fixes

## Issue: Application crashing with exit code 5 (Trace/BPT trap)

### Root Cause
The application was crashing due to a circular dependency in the `SettingsService.loadSettings()` method.

### Problem
In `SettingsService.swift`, the `loadSettings()` method was trying to access `SettingsService.shared.settingsKey` from a static context, but `shared` doesn't exist yet during initialization, creating a circular dependency.

### Solution
Fixed the circular dependency by using a local constant instead of accessing the shared instance:

**Before:**
```swift
private static func loadSettings() -> AppSettings {
    guard let data = UserDefaults.standard.data(forKey: SettingsService.shared.settingsKey),
          let settings = try? JSONDecoder().decode(AppSettings.self, from: data) else {
        return AppSettings.defaults
    }
    return settings
}
```

**After:**
```swift
private static func loadSettings() -> AppSettings {
    let settingsKey = "com.templatemanager.settings"
    guard let data = UserDefaults.standard.data(forKey: settingsKey),
          let settings = try? JSONDecoder().decode(AppSettings.self, from: data) else {
        return AppSettings.defaults
    }
    return settings
}
```

### Additional Fixes
1. **Fixed duplicate struct definition**: Removed duplicate `TemplateVariable` struct definition in `TemplateVariablesView.swift`
2. **Verified compilation**: Application now builds and runs successfully without errors

### Files Modified
- `/Users/ekodevapps/templatemanager/TemplateManager/Services/SettingsService.swift`
- `/Users/ekodevapps/templatemanager/TemplateManager/Views/TemplateVariablesView.swift`

### Testing
- ✅ Application compiles successfully
- ✅ Application runs without crashing
- ✅ No more exit code 5 errors
- ✅ GUI application launches properly

### Prevention
When using singleton patterns with static methods, ensure that static methods don't reference the shared instance to avoid circular dependencies during initialization.
