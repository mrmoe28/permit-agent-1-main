## 📊 Tracking Metrics

Track these metrics in development sessions:
- **Errors Fixed**: Count of issues resolved
- **Enhancements Added**: New features implemented
- **Files Modified**: Number of files changed
- **Build Status**: Current compilation state
- **Test Coverage**: Testing status
- **Performance**: Build times, app responsiveness

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Search and Filter
Use GitHub's search to find specific items:
- Search for "Error #" to find specific errors
- Search for "Enhancement #" to find features
- Use date ranges to find work from specific periods

### Cross-Reference
- Link related errors and enhancements
- Reference specific commits for detailed changes
- Connect to GitHub issues for community input

### Automation Opportunities
- Could add scripts to auto-generate session summaries
- Git hooks to remind about updating DEVELOPMENT.md
- Automated status updates based on commit messages
